# Arduino-USBRetroGamingControllers

Improve your retro gaming emulation experience by using the systems original controller.
This project provides code so you can bring back to life your old controller with native plug-and-play support for Microsoft Windows 7+ and Linux/RetroPie using an ATmega32u4 based Arduino.

This is the version 3.0 of the project 

This project currently includes support for:
* Classic Joystick
* NES clones
* Play Station 2
* SEGA Master System
* SEGA Mega Drive
* SNES


## Multijoy Retro Gaming System
With the above experience, I designed a circuit board and selector system so multiple controllers could all be connected and used on one system. The circuit board acts as a shield for an Arduino Micro that expands the available pins to make this possible. I created a quick demo of me playing popular games on this console with each controller.
